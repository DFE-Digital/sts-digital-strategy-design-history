### DfE guidance for naming a service
- Start with a verb
- Descriptive of the service
- Self explanatory

### Thoughts from user interviews
- Has to include “Digital”
- Needs to have DfE in it (so they know it is not a random company, schools get sales calls / emails everyday)
- Want to attract non technical people e.g. School Business Partners
- Positive and forward thinking
- Transformation, improvement, futuristic kind of words, don’t scare people off using words like Tech
- When you say help or support it gets peoples back up
- Do what it says on the tin
- You will have a lot of people who are sceptical so need a good marketing  

### Examples from user interviews
- Driving the Digital Journey
- Schools Technology Improvement Service / Team
- Preparing Schools for the Future
- Accelerating Technology - Helping boost technology & adoption in schools
- DfE Funding Technology
- EduGeek from the DfE
- Tech Dev


### Inital user research told us out service name need to be:

- Positive and forward thinking
- About moving to the next level
- Not focused on help or support which could be seen as patronising
- Simple and to the point
- Have the words DfE;....... from DfE was preferred
- Have a sense of optimism

Some names such as ***Make a technology plan*** had negative connotations. Schools may already have a plan, and feel this does not acknowledge that. Not considered enticing.

The name ***Plan for using tech in your school*** was considered straightforward, and the participant wouldn’t change the name.
