Participants have been shown potential options for how questions could be answered; these include yes/no, written text, multiple choice and RAG.

The preferred option was multiple choice as they believe these to be the easiest and quickest of the options and gives you prompts to think about.  

Both participants were confused over the use of RAG questions in this circumstance and don't seem it necessary.

Although we only tested these options with a small subset of participants we are confident that the multiple choice question pattern is the most appropriate.

We will continue testing with this format but with additional componts including a reveal text box for unkwon / none of the above answers as it was felt that while this pattern was suitable for definative answers there could be times when a user might stuggle to choose an approproiate answer so would need to give more details.
