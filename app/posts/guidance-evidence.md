## Start page
All participants are being shown one of the variations of the start page.

Overall, whilst the name and service proposal is understandable and clearly explains the purpose of the service - first impressions have been generally negative either they cant fully understand what it’s about or find it dull and would appreciate something more uplifting.

Participants throughout all the stages of the research we’ve conducted are looking to the future and want to see and embrace something different, particularly with regards to technology.

Participants feel the screens look like every other DfE screens which means they are easily aware its a gov site but it’s hard to differentiate between other services, so would be good to see something which makes it easy to distinguish.

The task based approach and familiarity with other ‘practical’ similar services implies a ‘box ticking’ exercise, placing the opportunity to explore the value of the service as a whole at risk.

## Case studies

Case studies have resonated well and are of value to see how other schools have achieved their goals.

It is important to show realistic, real life stories of ‘schools like mine’ rather than unachievable aspirational stories that are out of reach.

All participants would expect the evidence site to be structured with an initial split of Primary vs Secondary, before diving down into specific categories.

The formats of Video and text has been the most popular format to use, but it has been highlighted that people learn in different ways so we should provide alternative mixed media formats where possible.

Participants would read information providing it was clearly structured and sectioned, but would be put off by long reports.

It’s really powerful to see and hear ‘real life’ people talking about their experiences.
