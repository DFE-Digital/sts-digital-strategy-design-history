## Pre-Discovery

A previous Discovery that looked into the high level problems across a schools technology journey found:

“Some schools are doing much better than others when buying and using technology. This has created a huge discrepancy between schools in terms of tech provision for curriculum delivery in the classroom and the wider school infrastructure.”

This discrepancy was found to be due to the following factors:

- the existence of a Digital Strategy, or the extent to which it was fit for purpose
- affordability - particularly for those schools who do not have access to economies of scale (financial, capability etc)
- a lack of time to put into technology and its planning
- a lack of capability and expertise to apply to technology decision making - both planning and implementation

In addition, DfE has begun to publish its Digital Standards ([first release 23 March](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/meeting-digital-and-technology-standards-in-schools-and-colleges)) and is consulting on how schools and trusts could be accountable for addressing them. It is anticipated demand for help about how to plan for and implement the standards will increase.

The department's main support to help schools with strategic planning, the Ed Tech demonstrator programme, is not being renewed for AY 22/23, leaving a gap in support for schools strategically planning their technology investments.

This Discovery was commissioned to explore whether DfE can get schools to understand the importance of having a digital strategy, as well as support them to develop, build on and maintain one through an online tool.

## Problem Statement

Previous research indicates that schools often lack the time, money and expertise to think about technology proactively and holistically, and are not always able to evaluate what they need to do to make technology work for them. It’s hard for DfE to offer tailored, relevant support given the different levels of digital maturity across a complex landscape.

We think that by looking into how schools plan for technology depending on how digitally mature they are, we can get a better understanding of the challenges they face and find out how DfE can support them.

### Research Summary

### Creating a digital strategy requires many factors to be considered in the right order, building to a successful deployment of technology.

Whilst many ***schools ‘manage’ without much of a framework*** in place, to truly implement tech successfully, schools must give careful consideration each factor in turn.

Approaching each factor correctly ***‘unlocks’ the next stage in a meaningful and actionable fashion***, building on one another as a school moves up the pyramid.

However doing this is not a simple task, it requires ***leadership, time, resources, communication and support***, which are all significant issues we are already aware of.

The key to success will be providing a framework for schools to leverage, with enough flexibility to allow for their specific situation to maximise what they can achieve within the constraints they face.

### In the truly high maturity / technology embedded schools, the entire process is a continual loop, always looking for improvement, efficiencies, and both staff and pupil outcomes.

Technology never stops, and neither do the most mature schools.

Once they have the core layers of the strategy in place and are achieving against them, their objectives become more around fine-tuning and ***maximising the potential of the tech they have***, whilst keeping abreast of any developments happening that may further enhance their technology needs. Their strategy provides the foundations to do this.

Lower maturity schools don’t reach this point due to a number of factors, but key to it is the ***lack of strategy to provide those foundations*** to build upon.

This means they are caught in their own ***reactive cycle of firefighting***, or simply maintaining the status quo through device replacement.

Whilst some challenges can’t be avoided, if we can help them improve by a small % each cycle, better decisions and therefore outcomes will still be achievable over time.

## Assumptions

Schools want to increase their digital maturity in order to achieve the best outcomes
- Schools that are more digitally mature may be more likely to see a need for a strategy to achieve this

Strategy plays an important role in helping schools achieve their goals.
- But schools struggle with this aspect due to lack of expertise/time/knowing what good looks like.
- However most schools have SOME plans in place for tactical elements such as F&M - though this may not be tied into a broader strategy or vision.
- Goals will depend on what the school is trying to achieve but it could include realising educational vision, reducing staff burden, or simply meeting legislation.

The schools that do struggle don't know where to find relevant help
- There cannot be a one size fits all approach due to schools differing needs, but there is possibility to provide foundations to build upon.

Some schools have made the journey to maturity and have overcome obstacles/learned lessons along the way.
- These lessons could be beneficial to other schools on earlier stages of that journey.
- Whilst each school is different and has specific individual needs, the fundamental 'journey to maturity' and the outcomes it provides are likely to more universal.
- Understanding this will help identify areas / checkpoints where DfE can offer relevant support.

Schools struggle with having the right technology, capability, and/or strategy when trying to become digitally mature
- This has an impact on both the digital and educational goals the schools have, preventing them achieving both school/pupil outcomes.
